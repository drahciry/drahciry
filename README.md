### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="25px"> About Me

I'm a developer driven by a passion for not just writing code that works, but deeply understanding **why** it works. For me, programming is about building efficient, well-designed solutions, whether it's optimizing data access with the right data structure or applying software architecture principles to a simple project.

- 👨‍💻 I'm currently an **ABAP Developer Intern**, where I work with enterprise-level systems in the SAP ecosystem.
- 🎓 I'm a 4rd-period **Computer Science** student at the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), where I'm building a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and computer theory.
- 🌱 My goal is to become a versatile software engineer, and I'm building my path through the world of data. I am currently focused on developing deep expertise in **Data Analysis and Engineering**, with a keen interest in specializing in **Machine Learning and Neural Networks**.
- 💡 **My Philosophy:** No black boxes. I believe in mastering the fundamentals to solve complex problems effectively.
